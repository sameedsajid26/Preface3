  <h1>Free Joy from the Memory Dump!</h1>

  <p>Joy and Bing Bong are trapped together in the Memory Dump, the only way they can escape is to power the old wagon by guessing the correct password!</p>

  <p>You only have <strong>10 guesses and limited time</strong> (you will be alerted every 10 seconds).</p>

  <p>If you can't guess the correct password by then, the wagon will be broken, and you will be trapped here forever!</p>
